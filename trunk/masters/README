Welcome to Vegastrike!

First of all, a big thanks to Ludwig from the lokisetup icculus.org mailing
list.  Without his patience and help, we wouldn't have been able to get these
installers done :-)

For detailed instructions on how to play, see the manual included in the
installation directory.  An updated version may be available here:
