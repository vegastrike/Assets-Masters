				ANCHOR
			This is Jenny DeWilde for Galactic News Network.  
			Fighting has broken out in Garuda between the 
			Aera and the Andolians. We now go live to our 
			GNN correspondent in the field, Earnest Rigor. 
			Earnest, what's going on there?

Start battlefield background noise: wind, weapons fire paired with faint explosions, faint weapons fire paired with hit sounds and louder explosions

				REPORTER
			This is Earnest Rigor for GNN. The Aera 
			attack took everyone here completely by 
			surprise. The system was thought to be far 
			from the front lines and was lightly defended 
			as a result. The Andolians have called in all 
			available forces and requested support from 
			the Conderate forces as well. But, as you can 
			hear from the fighting here on the outskirts 
			of the capitol, the Aera have already 
			established a beachhead on the surface. 

				ANCHOR
			Earnest, how did this happen?

				REPORTER
			Well it's too early to tell, and the local 
			government is too busy with the battle to 
			address that now. But I am sure that this 
			incident will raise serious questions about 
			the state of the human defenses, how the Aera 
			forces got through the detection network, and 
			about the government's ability to protect 
			colonies further from the front lines.

				ANCHOR
			Well please stay safe, and we hope to hear 
			updates from you soon. Stay tuned for further 
			coverage of these events.
