News footers by Don "Turbo" Willadsen for Vegastrike game

This sound file contains the phrase "GNN" followed by a collection of "footers" adapted from Vegastrike's news.py file.  When mixing the audio for a news story, the intent is for these footers to be added at the end of the news story, much as they are in the text news available at starports and bases.  A complete footer consists of the "GNN" phrase followed by any one footer that fit the story's character.  The news authors may, at their discretion, omit the news footer from the audio entirely.
