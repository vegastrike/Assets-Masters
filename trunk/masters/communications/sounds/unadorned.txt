Unadorned faction voice acting, by Don "Turbo" Willadsen
---------------

The numbers are well today.

You are not part of my equations.

Even the infinite offers no escape for you.

The universe is functioning perfectly.

I appreciate the logic in your actions.

May logic guide you always.

The numbers are unclear - are you irrational, or the victim of chaotic accident?

Time waits not but awaits all.

You may yet see the errors in your approach.

All is determined, but remains unknown.

It is revealed. You seek unity with the empty set.

You are all chaos! Logic is lost on you!

My weapons calculate your inversion!

Your emotional arithmetic is flawed.

I will so thoroughly annihilate you, all record of your existence shall be uncomputed!

Death intercepts your timeline now.

Your death will make the universe more orderly!

I would sooner believe 0 and 1 to be the same!

Irrational beast!

Docking operation complete. You're free of the docking clamps.

You are not in docking clamps. Move into one of the green guide boxes and try to dock again.

Docking operation begun; press 0 to step into our starship.

You are not authorized to land here!

Clearance code acknowledged; move into landing pattern and dock at the white indicators.

Unable to comply.

Acknowledged.

Maintain speed and course for contraband search!

No contraband detected, you may proceed.

Contraband detected, target offender and fire at will!

Your course is deviating. Maintain course!

Request Clearance To Land.

Value and limit are unified.

One less variable.

Further resistance would be illogical.

I can see the code of the universe!

I have misread the numbers!

It appears we have something in common, privateer.  My name may be on your list, but now your name is on mine.
