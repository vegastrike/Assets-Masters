---------
Rlaan are arthropod-like beings with 4 mouths each containing 4 mandibles.  They breathe (methane) and therefore can also vocalize.  With 4 mouths, one could produce up to 4 different sounds simultaneously including clicks, clacks, aspirations, and tones.  

The four voices can be randomly mixed though we also get a nice result with DTMF tones (using the first 9-15 letters of the phrase) generated in a 1-second span, with 95% tone and 5% silence, speed (tempo & pitch) -87%, amplify -7 Db

+, -, and x indicate the moods friendly, hostile, or neutral
